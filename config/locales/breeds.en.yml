    # American Shorthair
    AS: 
      name: "American Shorthair"
      short_description: "The American Shorthair is a true breed of working cat. The general effect is that of a strongly built, well balanced, symmetrical cat with conformation indicating power, endurance, and agility."
      personality: "When describing the American Shorthair, the expression “happy medium” springs to mind. These all-American cats are medium in size, build, type, and temperament; they are neither too big nor too small, not overly cuddly nor distant, neither couch potatoes nor hyperactive. The American Shorthair is the perfect breed for those who want a cat that enjoys being in your lap but not in your face. American Shorthairs are known for their adaptable temperaments and quiet voices; they are sociable, easily trained, and adapt well to other animals and children. They generally do not like to be picked up; like their Pilgrim companions who left England to find freedom, they cherish their independence. Because of the American Shorthair’s history as a working cat, they make great companions in terms of health, strength, and vitality. American Shorthairs enjoy a good romp with their favorite humans, but can amuse themselves with a ball of paper just as well. They tend to remain active and playful well into their old age. Due to their barn cat background, ASHs have strong hunting instincts and enjoy catching and killing catnip mice—and real ones, too, if given access to the great outdoors, something that’s discouraged by breeders. Your indoor ASH will put presents on your pillow, usually well-killed catnip mice, and proudly wait for the well-deserved petting and praise."
      history: "No one knows exactly when domestic cats first set paw in America. However, it’s clear that cats arrived with the Europeans settlers, since America has no indigenous cat species from which domestic cats could have developed. Since cats were often kept aboard ships to protect the grain and other foodstuffs from rodents, it’s not surprising that domestic cats first appeared in North America when the Europeans arrived; North America has no indigenous species from which domestic cats could have developed. Domestic cats may have been catting around the New World since the 1500s. Unquestionably, domestic cats were present in Jamestown, the first permanent British colony in the New World, since a written record dating from 1609 mentions the colony’s cats. On July 4, 1776, when the members of the Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia to adopt the Declaration of Independence, the American Shorthair’s ancestors were around to witness the historic event. They were too busy ridding the barns and fields of mice to put their paw print alongside Thomas Jefferson’s signature, but they heartily approved of the document. After all, cats declared their independence thousands of years ago and hold the concept dear to their hearts to this day. Cats became working members of American society, performing that age-old service as the perfect mouser. Function was far more important than form, and folks paid little attention to the color, pattern, and body style of their mousers. Through natural selection— since life in those days was hard on cat and human alike—these feline immigrants developed powerful muscles, strong jaws, and hardy, healthy constitutions. In time, life became easier, and cats became more than mere mouse-catchers as people began to take an interest in the beauty of the feline form. At first, American Shorthairs were welcomed in the newly formed American cat fancy in the late 1800s. At that time, the breed was merely called Shorthair. Later, the breed was renamed Domestic Shorthair. The first American Shorthair to be registered in this country was an orange tabby male named Belle that ironically was imported from England in the early 1900s. It wasn’t until 1904 when the first American-born American Shorthair (named Buster Brown) was registered under the breed name of Shorthair. With the import of foreign breeds, the familiarity of the ASH no longer worked in its favor. Early in the 1900s, fanciers became more interested in the imported breeds like the Persian and Angora than in the familiar ASH that had warmed their laps and served them faithfully for so many years. The foreign imports crossed with the ASH, and the pure bloodlines of the American native became diluted. In the early 1900s, a group of fanciers who loved the sturdy look of their proud all-American cats began a selective breeding program to preserve the natural beauty, mild temperament, and hardiness of the American Shorthair. However, acceptance in the show ring was a long time coming. As late as the 1960s American Shorthairs were still treated like the strays of the cat fancy. Breeders also battled confusion between their carefully bred American Shorthairs and random-bred domestic cats. While a non-pedigreed domestic cat may look something like a pedigreed American Shorthair, the mix of genes means that a random-bred domestic generally will not breed true; you cannot count on type, temperament, and length of hair as you can with a pedigreed American Shorthair. In the late 1950s a number of ASH breeders, hoping to “improve” the breed and introduce new colors, began crossbreeding Persians into their American Shorthair lines. As a result, the American Shorthair body style and head type began to change, becoming more Persian in style. The face broadened and flattened, the eyes became rounder, the ears shorter. However, many American Shorthair breeders, who had struggled for decades to promote the natural beauty of the ASH, were dismayed at the changes. The American Shorthair standard was subsequently amended to disqualify any cat showing evidence of hybridization. In September 1965, breeders voted to change the breed’s name to “American Shorthair.” With the brand-new name came a brand-new image, and the breed finally received some of the esteem it deserved. The same year, CFA named a silver tabby male (Shawnee Trademark) Best Cat, and the breed finally began to receive some hard-earned respect in the cat fancy. Today, the American Shorthair is one of the most popular shorthairs, a fitting status for America’s hometown breed."

    # Bengal
    BG: 
      name: "Bengal"
      short_description: "The Bengal is a descendant from the Asian leopard cats and has the physical features distinctive to these small forest-dwelling wildcats but with the loving, dependable temperament of a family pet."
      personality: "The Bengal may look like a wild cat, but this breed is as friendly as any domestic cat. Full of life and very people-oriented, the Bengal is playful, energetic and with a good dose of curiosity. Bengals form a strong bond of love and loyalty with their family and become loyal, affectionate, pleasant friends, provided you meet them halfway and give them the love they need.<br><br>Athletic and agile, Bengals love to climb and will gravitate toward the highest point in any room. Bengals are often a great source of entertainment. One of the main characteristics that makes them so special as companions is their intelligence. It's no surprise that the Bengal is so clever, surviving in the jungle takes wit as well as lightning fast reflexes! <br><br>Bengals learn very quickly, and enjoy learning new behaviors. In fact, they may learn tricks you’d rather they didn’t, such as turning on and off light switches, opening doors, and flushing toilets. The curious Bengal may get into everything, and changes in the home often provoke a quick response from the Bengal. Open a cupboard and your Bengal may dive in for a look-see, and will rearrange the contents if they’re not up to his standards.<br><br>Because of the leopard cat’s habit of eliminating in water to hide their scent from larger predators, some Bengals learn to use the toilet. Like their wild relatives, Bengals relish their freedom; they dislike being held or restrained. This isn’t unique to Bengals but to most very active breeds. Bengals often love water, particularly if it’s running. Some only dip an occasional paw under the faucet, while others may try to go for a romp in the tub or shower—as long as it’s their idea. Some report that their cats’ fascination with water borders on obsession, and steps must be taken to keep floods to a minimum; Bengal owners quickly learn to keep the toilet lid down."
      history: "The Bengal breed originated as a hybrid of a domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus) and a leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis). The leopard cat looks very much like a domestic cat, except for the larger, snapping eyes, pronounced whisker pads, longer legs, and brilliant leopard-style markings. It looks, in fact, like a miniature leopard.<br><br>The Bengal breed began when a female leopard cat was purchased from a pet store. Unlike today, at the time leopard cats could be purchased at pet stores in the United States. This is no longer the case due these cat’s special needs and state requirements. The intent of purchasing the leopard cat was not to create a new breed of cat, the individual, Jean Mill, simply wanted a unique pet.<br><br>After several years, Mill thought her little leopard cat looked lonely, so she obtained male domestic cat to keep her company. While completely unintended and to her surprise, in 1965, her leopard cat produced a litter. Only one kitten survived, a female hybrid named Kin-Kin. Mill contacted Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ithaca, New York, for advice on how to handle the hybrid, and was told that Kin-Kin was probably sterile. That proved to be not the case, since Kin-Kin grew up, mixed with her domestic father, and produced two kittens. One of the kittens inherited the sweet domestic disposition of his father.<br><br>After some consideration, Mill decided that creating a crossbred breed would benefit the plight of the leopard cats, while providing the American market with an acceptable and domesticated spotted substitute. And she set about trying to do just that. Later, it was learned that only after the cats were four generations away from the leopard cat that the Bengal’s temperament became more predictably domestic.<br><br>Still, many obstacles had to be overcome along the way. The first hybrid kittens (first generation cats are called F1s) often grew up to be nervous, shy cats similar to their wild relatives. Only after the cats were several generations away from the leopard cat that the temperament became sweet and predictable. Another factor that slowed the breed’s progress was that for several generations the breed could only develop via the female kittens born, since the male kittens are sterile, as is true of many hybrids. Second generation males (F2s) are sterile as well, and only about 50% of the third generation males (F3s) are fertile.<br><br>In 1985, she had sufficient generations who have become today’s Bengal. Current standards require that Bengals must be at least four generations (F4 or more) to ensure a mild, docile temperament and a happy, healthy pet cat. All associations other than the CFA have fully accepted the Bengal. Bengals have proven to their satisfaction that the they are fully domestic in temperament and no danger to anyone in the household. Today, the exotic look and lively personality have won the Bengal an enthusiastic following."

    # Birman  
    BI: 
      name: "Birman"
      short_description: "A cat of mystery and legend, the Birman is a colorpointed cat with long silky hair and four pure white feet. They are often strongly built, elongated and stocky, neither svelte nor stocky. Their distinctive head has strong jaws, firm chin, and medium length nose."
      personality: "Birmans are affectionate, gentle, and faithful companions with an air of dignity that seems to invite adoration by their families. As former temple cats, Birmans seem to have become accustomed to adoration. They are very intelligent and affectionate, according to some, are often very people-oriented. They will generally greet visitors with curiosity rather than fear. Because of their gentle temperaments, Birmans are usually easy to handle, care for, and they make ideal pets for anyone who wants quiet companions that will offer love and affection."
      history: "According to the centuries-old legend, pure white cats resided in the Buddhist temples of the country of Burma (now Myanmar), and were revered as the feline carriers of the souls of priests who had departed the mortal plain. (The term for this process is transmutation, which means to change from one form to another.) The Goddess of transmutation, Tsim-Kyan-Kse, was worshiped in these temples, represented by a golden statue with glowing sapphire eyes. Mun-Ha, a priest and worshiper of Tsim-Kyan-Kse, served at the temple of Lao-Tsun. Every evening Mun-Ha’s faithful companion Sinh, one of the 100 sacred white cats that lived at the temple, joined Mun-Ha for his evening prayers in front of the golden statue.<br><br>One day, marauders from Siam raided the temple for its riches and struck down Mun-Ha. As Mun-Ha lay dying, Sinh put his paws on Mun-ha’s head and faced the statue of Tsim-Kyan-Kse. Suddenly, Sinh’s white fur changed to a beautiful golden hue, his face, tail, and legs darkened to the color of the earth, and his eyes changed from yellow to a deep, sapphire blue. Sinh’s paws, however, remained white as a symbol of Mun-Ha’s pure spirit. The next morning, all the temple cats had undergone the same transformation. For the next seven days Sinh refused all food and finally died, carrying Mun-Ha’s spirit into paradise.<br><br>The more scientific, and less romantic, story of this breed, also called the Sacred Cat of Burma, begins in 1919, when a pair of Birman cats arrived in France. Two different accounts are associated with this pair of cats and, like the legend, neither can be documented. The first one alleges that around the beginning of the twentieth century, the temple of Tsim-Kyan-Kse was again raided. Two Westerners, Auguste Pavie and Major Gordon Russell, helped some of the priests and their sacred cats escape to Tibet. When the two returned to France in 1919, they were given a pair of Birman cats by the grateful priests.<br><br>In the second and less heroic account, an individual named Mr. Vanderbilt bought the pair of Birmans from a disgruntled servant of the temple of Lao-Tsun. In both accounts, the male cat, Maldapour, died on the ocean voyage to France, but the female, Sita, arrived in France pregnant with Maldapour’s offspring, and became the European foundation of the Birman breed.<br><br>The breed flourished, and in 1925 the Birman was formally recognized in France. The breed was enjoyed in that country until the chaos of World War II, when the breed almost became extinct. At one point, the Birman breed again dwindled to a single pair of cats. It took many years to reestablish the Birman; the breeds used to revive the breed were likely Persians and Siamese (and possibly others, such as the Turkish Angora), but by 1955 the breed had achieved its former glory.<br><br>In 1959, the first pair of Birman cats arrived in the United States, and in 1967 CFA officially accepted the Birman. Since then, the Birman has flourished in North America and has become a popular and well-known breed. Today, the Birman is one of the most popular longhaired breeds."

    # Bombay
    BO: 
      name: "Bombay"
      short_description: "The Bombay is a medium-size cat, well-balanced, friendly, alert, and outgoing; muscular and having a surprising weight for their size. Their body and tail is usually of medium length, their head rounded with medium-sized, wide-set ears, a moderate nose stop, which is visible, large rounded wide-set eyes."
      personality: "If an aloof, independent cat is what you’re searching for, this breed isn’t for you. The Bombay is an endearing breed: playful, loving, lighthearted, and agreeable to just about any suggestion from their family, particularly if that includes an invigorating game of fetch or a cuddle on the couch.<br><br>Due to their hybrid heritage, Bombays strike a pleasing balance between the moderate American Shorthair and the frisky, vocal Burmese. However, since the American Shorthair is less prominent today, Bombays tend to be more like the Burmese than like the American Shorthair.<br><br>They are very clever and people-oriented (thanks to the Burmese background), but won’t talk your ear off every second of the day (thanks to the American Shorthair). However, Bombays will get their thoughts across if they have something vital to impart, and you can count on them to stare you down with those hypnotizing copper eyes and repeat the message until you give them your full attention. They want quite a bit of attention, and they are clever in their attempts to gain your notice. When you sit down, don’t be surprised to see your Bombay sitting beside you moments later.<br><br>Bombays are very attached to their families and tend to love the entire family rather than bond with one person. Some say they are particularly good with well-behaved children. Known for their curiosity and high intelligence, Bombays love to follow their human companions all over the house. They love to keep an eye on every move and help with every chore. This doesn’t get the chores done faster, but it’s certainly entertaining."
      history: "The Bombay began in the 1950s by Nikki Horner. She wanted to develop a cat that possessed the look of the Burmese but with a sleek black coat and copper eyes instead of brown fur and yellow eyes—sort of a pint-sized panther. She named the breed after Bombay, India, land of the black leopard.<br><br>She found a black American Shorthair male that had the rich eye color she wanted and crossed him with one of her best Burmese. After much trial and error, Horner finally produced the results she was looking for: a cat with the body type and short polished coat of the Burmese, and the American Shorthair’s copper-colored eyes and black color. However, Horner soon found that creating a breed, even one as striking as the Bombay, doesn’t mean recognition or acceptance. It wasn’t until 1970 that the breed was accepted for registration by the CFA.<br><br>The Bombay is considered an Asian self-colored shorthair. While still uncommon in both the United Kingdom and in North America, the breed has a dedicated following."

    # British Shorthair
    BS: 
      name: "British Shorthair"
      short_description: "The British Shorthair is a compact, well-balanced, and powerful cat, with a short, very dense coat. They often convey an overall impression of balance and proportion in which no feature is exaggerated."
      personality: "If you’re looking for a cat that will loot your refrigerator and swing dizzily from your chandeliers, then the British Shorthair is not for you. Some say the British Shorthair is the perfect household companion if you like a breed that’s undemanding, not always underfoot or in your face. British Shorthairs like to keep a low profile; they are affectionate but not clingy, playful but not overactive. They are quiet, even-tempered, and undemanding with a bit of typical British reticence, particularly when they’re first introduced.<br><br>When they get over their initial reserve, however, they become extremely faithful companions. British Shorthair need love and attention if they are to become the loyal, loving companions they can be; the more attention and affection you give them, the more they will repay you in kind. Once they get to know and trust you, British Shorthair are confident and devoted, and enjoy following you from room to room to keep an eye on your activities. They are calm, quiet companions, appreciating quality time without demanding your total attention.<br><br>British Shorthair can make great apartment cats, being alert and playful without being hyper or destructive. British Shorthairs tend to show their loyalty to the entire family rather than select one person with whom to bond. They tend to be more independent than many breeds and usually adapt well to most situations. British Shorthairs tend not to be vocal cats; they make tiny squeaking sounds rather than meows, which is quite humorous coming from those burly bodies. They make up for it by some of the loudest purring you’ve ever heard; British Shorthairs are often known for their motor boat type purrs.<br><br>One thing Brits are not, however, is lap cats. They’d much rather sit beside you, or curl up at your feet, than cuddle on your lap. British Shorthairs dislike being picked up, and tolerate it with legs stiffly stretched out to push you away. They detest being kissed, too, but head presses are acceptable, and they accept petting with great enthusiasm and mighty purrs of appreciation. They get along with other animals in the home, including dogs as long as the proper introductions are made. British Shorthairs are at their very best with children, and children love these plush smiling friends."
      history: "The British Shorthair is native to Great Britain in the same way that the American Shorthair is native to America—long ago it was transported there from somewhere else. However, the progenitor of the Brit, as it’s affectionately called, is probably Great Britain’s oldest natural breed of cat, and was roaming around Great Britain for centuries before its cousin journeyed to the New World.<br><br>In many ways, the British Shorthair’s struggle for recognition resembles the American Shorthair’s in North America. Both began as working cats and weren’t appreciated as the special breeds they are for many years. The British Shorthair originated from a common street cat once called the European Shorthair. This breed, whose appearance is much different from the Brits you’ll see today, came to Great Britain some 2,000 years ago, courtesy of the Roman Empire. As they conquered and colonized other lands, the Romans brought cats along with them to protect their homes from rodents. These cats had been obtained from the Egyptians, who were very tight-pawed with their treasured felines. Eventually, however, Phoenician caravans transported them along trade routes, and Roman armies smuggled them out of Egypt and carried them along to many lands. Although the Phoenicians first introduced cats to England, the Romans were most likely responsible for their widespread establishment when Rome invaded the British Isles. Eventually, the Romans were driven from the Isles, but the cats they had brought with them remained.<br><br>The cats left behind didn’t look like today’s British Shorthair. Lithe with long, elegant bones, these cats were sandy brown or yellow-gray in color, with ticked coats like the Abyssinian and tabby markings on their face, legs, and tail. They were probably members of, or closely related to, the African wildcat, Felis silvestris lybica, the progenitor of all domestic cats. After arriving in Europe, however, they mixed with the European wildcat, Felis silvestris silvestris, a local wildcat subspecies inhabiting most of Europe. This caused a shift in both coat and body style, since the European wildcat has a broad head, small wide-set ears, a sturdy, muscular body, and short, thick fur.<br><br>Some European wildcats bear the mackerel tabby pattern; this common tabby pattern found today in so many breeds and mixed-bred cats may have arisen from the European wildcat. Because of the colder and wetter conditions, the cats in Europe developed stocky, muscular body styles and thicker, water-repelling coats that were favorable to the climate. For hundreds of years, these cats earned their livings protecting from rodents in Great Britain’s barns, granaries, alleys, gardens, and households. From these working cats, the British Shorthair developed into a stalwart, substantial breed. In the 1800s, residents started to appreciate these hardy alley cats for their beauty, strength, personality, and their value as companions.<br><br>Blue British Shorthairs, at first simply called “Shorthairs,” were favorites of cat enthusiast Harrison Weir. Mr. Weir was instrumental in getting the British Shorthair recognized as a breed in its own right.  While they became popular for some time there after, just before the turn of the century, longhaired exotics caught people’s eye and British Shorthairs declined in popularity. Nevertheless, British Shorthairs held their own until the chaos of World War II decimated the breed, along with most other European breeds as well. After the war, efforts were dedicated to preserving the British Shorthair breed. It took many generations to bring the breed back to their former glory, but eventually they prevailed.<br><br>Americans took little notice of the British Shorthair until the 1960s.  In 1970, ACFA recognized the breed for championship in only one color—solid blue—and under the now obsolete name “British Blue.” Blue was, and still is, the most common color both here and in Great Britain. The breed slowly earned supporters, and between 1970 and 1980 British Shorthairs were officially recognized in all the many colors of the breed. Today, the British Shorthair has an active following. In Great Britain, the breed also has many fans."

    # Burmese
    BU: 
      name: "Burmese"
      short_description: "The Burmese is a cat of medium size with substantial bone structure, good muscular development, and a surprising weight for their size. This together with a rounded head, expressive eyes, and a sweet expression presents a totally distinctive cat who is comparable to no other breed."
      personality: "Many say that Burmese are amusing, playful, and super-smart, the perfect interactive cats for the home —or any place people are in need of love and amusement. Devoted, loving cats, Burmese are often loyal and people-oriented. Burmese will give you unconditional love even when you are not your most loveable.<br><br>Burmese seem to never grow up; they are as entertaining at 16 weeks as they are at 16 years. These streaks of brown lightning love to perform animated antics for your amusement and theirs. Full of high-spirited playfulness, they love to entertain their families by performing daring leaps to the top of the bookcase, pausing only to make sure their audience is watching. If their antics go unnoticed, they hop right down and fix you with an unflinching stare, demanding attention. Burmese are a very determined breed, and will win just about any battle of wills.<br><br>There may be temperament differences between adult males and females. Females are intelligent, highly curious, active, and deeply emotionally involved with their human companions. Males are wholly devoted to their humans too, but are a bit more moderate in temperament. After a game of fetch or hide and seek (they hide, you seek), they like to lounge about, usually on top of what ever you’re doing. The only issue about which they are passionately concerned is the selected cuisine and how soon it will be served.<br><br>Burmese have a unique rasp to their voices and sound a bit like cats going hoarse from too much talking. However, Burmese are not as talkative as their Siamese neighbors, unless they have something important to express. Then they’ll reiterate the message repeatedly until you get out your universal feline/human translator and take care of whatever is troubling them."
      history: "The Burmese as we know and love it today can be traced back to a single female domestic cat named Wong Mau. In 1930, Wong Mau was transported into the United States from Rangoon, Burma (now Yangon, Myanmar), by Dr. Joseph Thompson of San Francisco. As the story goes, an unnamed sailor gave the feline to Dr. Thompson, who brought her home to the City by the Bay. Wong Mau was a small, fine-boned cat with a compact body, a rounded, short-muzzled head, round eyes set far apart, and a short, walnut-brown coat with darker brown on her face, ears, feet, and tail.<br><br>Dr. Thompson was very taken with Wong Mau, since she looked like cats he’d seen in Tibet. Dr. Thompson had served as a U.S. Navy doctor for some years and developed a strong interest in Southeast Asia. He spent time in a monastery in Tibet and was enchanted by the shorthaired, solid brown cats in the area. These felines, called “copper cats” in their native land for their rich brown color, have existed in Southeast Asia for centuries. They were depicted and described in the ancient text The Cat-Book Poems, a manuscript of verses and paintings written in the city of Ayutthaya, Siam, some time between 1350 c.e. when the kingdom was founded, and 1767 c.e. when the city was destroyed by invaders. As the legend goes, the Burmese is a descendant of a breed once worshipped in Burmese temples as embodiments of gods. The Cat-Book Poems also shows pictures of Siamese and what is likely Korat cats, suggesting these cats existed as separate, definable breeds for centuries.<br><br>Dr. Thompson was so taken with Wong Mau’s beauty and personality that the doctor wanted to create a program to isolate Wong Mau’s distinguishing characteristics so he could reproduce her type and color. He enlisted the help of several people, including that of anoted geneticist Dr. Clyde E. Keeler of Harvard University. Wong Mau was crossed with a sealpoint Siamese male named Tai Mau. The resulting kittens showed three different colors and patterns: beige, sable brown, and pointed. In the process, Dr. Thompson discovered that Wong Mau herself was a Siamese hybrid—half Siamese and half Burmese, what we would call a Tonkinese today. Since the pointed pattern is a recessive trait and a cat must inherit a copy of the gene from both parents to have the pattern, Wong Mau herself must have possessed the gene for the pointed pattern. Later, it was discovered that the Burmese gene responsible for the sable color is a member of the albino series of gene alleles. The Burmese gene causes solid black to appear dark sable brown by reducing the amount of pigment in the hair.<br><br>In 1936, CFA accepted the Burmese for registration, and Burmese cats were an immediate hit when they were introduced into North America in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Most cat lovers took an immediate liking to these beautiful brown cats. The results of the original program were published in the April 1943 Journal of Heredity, written by Dr. Thompson, Virginia Cobb, Billie Gerst, and Dr. Clyde E. Keeler. Unfortunately, Dr. Thompson died of a heart attack while the paper was in publication. The paper brought the Burmese more attention and fans.<br><br>The actual look of the Burmese has changed over time, achieving the diversity and current appearance through the years. Almost thirty years ago, two distinct head types emerged: the Contemporary Burmese and the European Burmese."

    # Chartreux
    CX: 
      name: "Chartreux"
      short_description: "The Chartreux is a sturdy, shorthaired French breed coveted in antiquity for its hunting prowess and its dense, water repellent fur. Though strongly built, Chartreux cats are extremely supple and agile; refined, never coarse nor clumsy."
      personality: "Today, Chartreux cats are popular because they make terrific companions. They are amiable, loyal, loving, and adaptable, and when you sit down next to your Chartreux, you invariably end up with an exquisitely soft lapful of adoring blue feline. <br><br>Chartreux are the strong silent types of the cat fancy; they keep their comments to themselves, even when standing beside empty food dishes. Chartreux may open their mouths as if to meow, but no sound comes out. When they do vocalize, it’s usually with small chirps or trills—it’s amazing to hear tiny chirps come out of those large, powerful bodies and strong jaws. They do purr with the greatest enthusiasm, however, particularly when you’re serving up their favorite snack. In addition, quality time with their preferred persons always make them smile. Nevertheless, Chartreux cats have a quiet but well-developed sense of humor, and enjoy a good joke, particularly if it’s at your expense.<br><br>Known for their hunting prowess and their strong hunting instinct, they love toys that move, preferably by human power. Feathered toys that whirl through the air are particular favorites. They easily learn to play fetch and enjoy frolicking with other felines and sometimes even an agreeable dog—and their human friends, of course. They are very intelligent cats; they quickly learn their names and if you like a good challenge you can even teach them to come when you call—if they’re in the mood, of course. This cat is the perfect feline friend; in return for a bowl of food, a clean litterbox, and a soft bed (yours) to sleep on, you get a constant companion that entertains, loves, and cheers you up with its angelic smile and sweet devotion."
      history: "The Chartreux, a true blue cat with a Mona Lisa smile and an amiable temperament, is France’s contribution to the cat fancy. Since the Chartreux has been around for so many centuries, it’s hard to say with certainty just where and when it first developed. Like most breeds with long histories, the Chartreux tale is the stuff of legends. <br><br>The most popular account tells that the Chartreux was bred by monks at the Grande Chartreuse Monastery, the chief monastery of the Carthusian order, located north of Grenoble in southeastern France. As the story goes, the Carthusian order of monks at the monastery, in their spare time between praying, liqueur-making, and weapon-forging, bred Chartreux cats with the same skill and dedication with which they created their world-famous yellow and green Chartreuse liqueurs. Allegedly, they selectively bred the cats to have quiet voices so as not to disturb the monks’ meditations. It’s a lovely, romantic tale, but a tale is likely all it is, since the monastery’s records do not mention cats, blue or any other color. <br><br>A mention of the Chartreux breed, however, is found in the 1749 36-volume Histoire Naturelle (Natural History) by French biologist Comte de Buffon, who lists four cat breeds common in Europe at that time: Domestic, Angora, Spanish, and Chartreux. According to Jean Simonnet’s definitive 1980 book The Chartreux Cat, the Chartreux probably came from the Near East, and the cat described as the Cat of Syria by the Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi (1522–1605), was likely its ancestor. In Jean Simonnet’s book, an illustration of the Cat of Syria shows a stocky cat with solid blue coloring and vivid, slightly almond-shaped copper colored eyes. Beside the cat, a brown mouse cowers, a testament to the Chartreux’s strong hunting instincts, and one of the reasons the breed was so highly prized. Brought to Europe from the Near East countries in merchant ships, the Chartreux became established as a French breed. That the Chartreux survived at all is a testament to the breed’s endurance and flexibility, since for many centuries members of the breed weren’t treated with the kindness and love they’ve earned today. Primarily street cats, they were prized for their rat-catching prowess and, for a time, for their luxurious pelts. As Jean Simonnet notes, “One can truly say that the Chartreux cats beloved to us formerly did not have the ‘best of times’ with our countrymen.” <br><br>The modern history of the breed began in the 1920s when two sisters, Christine and Suzanne Leger, discovered a colony of plush, shorthaired blue cats in the city of Le Palais on Belle Ile Island off the coast of Brittany in northwest of France. These free-roaming cats lived on the grounds of a hospital and matched the description of the Chartreux. The people of Le Palais called them “hospital cats,” and the Leger sisters were taken with their beauty and thick blue coats. Christine and Suzanne Leger were the first to work seriously with the breed, and in 1931 they exhibited the cats in Paris. The breed became popular, but  World War II intervened, decimating the country and the breed. After the war, the few remaining Chartreux were bred with blue British Shorthairs, Russian Blues, and Persians, to keep the bloodlines going. Today, du chat des Chartreux (The Chartreux Cat Club) works to preserve, promote, and protect the Chartreux."

    # Himalayan
    HI: 
      name: "Himalayan"
      short_description: "The Himalayan is a hybrid breed identical to the Persian, but distinguished by the points on the cats’ extremities (the facial mask, feet, ears, and tail) which results in a Persian-type cat with the coloring and deep blue eyes of the Siamese-patterned cat."
      personality: "“Himmies,” as they are sometimes called, are wonderful indoor cat companions. They are gentle, calm, and sweet-tempered, and possess a playful side as well. Like the Siamese, Himalayans love to play fetch, and a scrap of crumpled paper or a kitty toy will entertain them for hours, or until their next nap. Himalayans are devoted and dependent upon their humans for companionship and protection. They crave affection and love to be petted and groomed, which is fortunate, since every Himalayan owner will spend part of each day doing just that. Like their Persian siblings, they are docile and won’t harass you for attention the way some breeds will. They possess the same activity level as the Persian, and they are not vocal like the Siamese."
      history: "The first deliberate cross between a Siamese and a Persian was made in 1924 by a Swedish geneticist. In 1935 that the first pointed pattern longhair was born. In the early 1930s, two Harvard medical researchers crossed a Siamese female with a black Persian male, not to create a new breed, but to establish how certain characteristics were inherited. This mating produced a litter of black, shorthaired kittens. They then bred a black Persian female with a Siamese male. The outcome was the same. This is not surprising, since longhair and the colorpoint pattern are both governed by recessive genes. Both parents have to possess the genes in order for the traits to be expressed in the offspring. By crossing a female from the second litter with a male from the first, they produced Debutante, a cat that possessed the Siamese body type and color pattern and the long hair of the Persian. During the same year, British and American fanciers hoped to produce a pointed pattern breed with the Persian hair type and conformation. World War II interfered with these efforts. In 1950 American Marguerita Goforth succeeded in breeding the long awaited Persian-like colorpoint. CFA and ACFA recognized the breed in 1957 under the name Himalayan, named for the color pattern found in other animals such as the Himalayan rabbit. By 1961, all major U.S. cat associations recognized the Himalayan.<br><br>Because Himalayans are regularly crossed with Persians, many cat associations have special rules for Himalayan-Persian hybrids, usually allowing them to be shown either as Himalayans or Persians, depending upon their appearance. Whatever the breed is called, the Himalayan remains a popular breed with a solid following."

    # Maine Coon
    MC: 
      name: "Maine Coon"
      short_description: "The Maine Coon is solid, rugged, and can endure a harsh climate. A distinctive characteristic of this cat is the smooth, shaggy coat. This breed is well-proportioned, has a balanced appearance, and has adapted to varied environments."
      personality: "No breed has a monopoly on love and affection, but there’s got to be some good reason that Maine Coons have clawed their way up from near extinction to the prized place of America’s second most popular breed (according to the CFA’s registration totals). Maine Coon fans say that the popularity is due to the breed’s large size, intelligence, luxuriant coat, hardy disposition, and devotion to their human family.<br><br>Maine Coons are kittens in big cat suits, gentle giants who are playful well into old age, as well as jumbo-sized packages of loving devotion. Maine Coons can also be reserved around people with whom they’re not familiar, probably due to their jumbo-sized brains. Given time, however, even the most cautious adapt. This initial adjustment period is actually a decision-making process; Maine Coons are deciding if these new humans have proven themselves worthy of trust. As soon as they make up their minds, however, they form close bonds with the entire household and become loving and devoted.<br><br>Most want to be near you but not on your lap. They are true family members and participate in all family routines, whether watching you channel surf from the comfort of the couch, or following you from room to room. As befits a former seafarer, Maine Coons are fascinated by water, perhaps because their thick coats are water-repellent and won’t become annoyingly soaked as easily as a thinner coat would. Some will join their humans in the shower briefly, or at least walk around on the wet floor after you get out. They prefer to stand on the edge of the tub, however, and touch the water with a curious paw."
      history: "Maine Coons, like American Shorthairs, are considered native to America because they’ve been on this continent since the colonial days, and perhaps longer. How they got here in the first place and where their progenitors came from, however, is anyone’s guess, since none of the local colonists happened by with their camera phones to record the event.<br><br>Many imaginative stories exist about the origin of the breed (some more believable than others), but hard proof is as elusive as a cat at bath time. One story alleges that the breed is a raccoon/domestic cat hybrid, thus the name Maine Coon. Even though both raccoons and Maine Coons have lush, long tails and the tendency to dunk their food into their drinking water, such a union is biologically impossible. Another anecdote, unlikely but at least possible, holds that the Maine Coon was produced by bobcat/domestic cat trysts, which would explain the ear and toe tufts and the impressive size of the breed. A more imaginative story claims that Maine Coons are descendants of longhaired cats belonging to Marie Antoinette. The Queen’s cats and other belongings were smuggled to America by a captain named Clough, who was preparing to rescue the Queen from her rendezvous with the guillotine. Unfortunately, the Queen lost her head, and the cats ended up staying with Clough in Maine. Last, but not least, is the tale of a sea captain named Coon who, in the 1700s, brought longhaired cats with him on his excursions to America’s northeastern coast. Allegedly, these longhaired buccaneers mixed with the local population while on shore leave.<br><br>This last story has at least a ring of truth. Seafarers who used cats to control rodent populations on their sailing ships probably brought some longhaired cats with them to the New World. Some of the cats went ashore when they reached the northeastern coast and established themselves on the farms and in the barns of the early settlers. Given Maine’s severe climate, those initial years must have been tough on cat and human alike. Only the breed’s strongest and most adaptable survived. Through natural selection, the Maine Coon developed into a large, rugged cat with a dense, water-resistant coat and a hardy constitution.<br><br>Regardless of where the breed came from, the Maine Coon was one of the first breeds to be recognized by the late nineteenth-century cat fancy, and became an early favorite. However, in the early 1900s, as new and more exotic breeds were brought into the country, Maine Coons were abandoned for Persians, Angoras, and others. By 1950, the breed had all but vanished and in fact was declared extinct in the 1950s.<br><br>Fortunately, the announcement of the Maine Coon’s demise was greatly exaggerated, and today these cats have regained their former glory, second only to the Persian in popularity."

    # Munchkin
    MK: 
      name: "Munchkin"
      short_description: "The Munchkin cat has no problem getting around the same as its longer-limbed feline friends — it just might take them a few extra steps along the way. These cute, curious cats are known for snatching shiny objects, so don’t be surprised if these “magpies” borrow your favorite piece of jewelry."
      personality: "For their part, Munchkins, oblivious to the controversy surrounding them, go on being just what they are—cats—self-assured and outgoing. Shortchanged in the leg department doesn’t mean short on intelligence or personality. Friendly and people-oriented, Munchkins make devoted companions, and they get along well with other cats, dogs, and people. They love to wrestle and play with their long-legged feline friends, happily unaware that there’s anything different about them. Nor do their feline companions treat them as members of the vertically challenged. It’s only humans who look at them askance.<br><br>Fanciers assert Munchkins can do anything an ordinary cat can do, except leap to the top of the kitchen counter. Some fanciers consider this a feature, however, instead of a disadvantage. Despite the short legs, Munchkins run fast, bounding like ferrets and taking corners at full speed. To get a better view, they often sit up on their haunches rather like prairie dogs. They can climb cat posts and curtains as well as any cat. However, they can’t jump as high because the shorter back legs don’t provide as much leverage. Munchkins can jump onto most beds, chairs, and couches, but may take a scenic route onto a chair or other lower item before attempting your desk.<br><br>Munchkins are also known as magpies, often borrowing small, shiny objects and stashing them away for later play. Proficient hunters, Munchkins love a good game of catnip mouse, but when playtime is over, they want a warm lap to snuggle into and strokes from a loving hand, like any cat."
      history: "The cat fancy’s version of downsizing— the Munchkin—has cat fanciers on both sides hissing over whether the breed should be recognized. While most new breeds have to face periods of resistance before acceptance can occur, the battle over this breed has been particularly long and heated because it raises questions regarding where unique variety ends and abomination begins. This point has been previously raised within the cat fancy concerning breeds such as the Sphynx and the Manx, now widely accepted breeds.<br><br>Short-legged cats have been documented as early as the 1930s in England. According to records, these short-legged cats survived for four generations before World War II took its toll on the cat population of Europe. One such cat was also reported in the Soviet Union in the 1950s and dubbed the “Stalingrad Kangaroo Cat” for its tendency to sit up on its haunches. But the breed as we know it today began in Louisiana, USA.<br><br>In 1983 music teacher Sandra Hochenedel of Rayville, Louisiana discovered two cats hiding under a pickup truck where they had been cornered by a dog. Hochenedel rescued the cats and took them home, later noticing three things—both were female, both were pregnant, and both had short, stubby legs on normal-sized bodies. She kept Blackberry, the black-haired kitty, and gave away Blueberry, the gray-haired cat. What happened to Blueberry is unknown; all of today’s registered Munchkins can be traced back to Blackberry and one of her sons.<br><br>When Blackberry had her litter, Hochenedel discovered that Blackberry had given birth to both short and ordinary long-legged kittens. One of the kittens, a handsome male Hochenedel named Toulouse after French painter Toulouse-Lautrec who, due to a bone disease, had an adult-sized torso but child-sized legs. Hochenedel gave Toulouse to Kay LaFrance, a friend who lived in Monroe, Louisiana. Using Toulouse, LaFrance established her own colony of Munchkins on her Louisiana plantation. Since LaFrance’s cats were allowed free access to the outdoors and were not altered, a semi-feral population of Munchkins developed around Monroe, where they competed very well with their long-legged friends for prey and mating opportunities. Blackberry vanished after having only a few litters, but her genetic legacy continued. Since LaFrance allowed Blackberry’s son, Toulouse, to wander around unaltered, in short order a good sized population of short-legged cats lived on LaFrance’s property. Since cats in heat care little about their partners’ leg length (or much of anything else), Toulouse and his short-legged offspring had no trouble competing for mates with their longer-legged rivals.<br><br>Hochenedel and LaFrance, seeing how well the cats were doing on their own, thought this might be the beginning of a new breed. They named the breed after the little people of Munchkinland from the classic 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz, and contacted Dr. Solveig Pflueger, M.D., Ph.D., allbreed judge and TICA’s genetics committee chair. Dr. Pflueger conducted a study to assess the inheritance and expression of the Munchkin’s short legs. She found that an autosomal dominant gene (a dominant gene residing on a chromosome that’s not a sex chromosome) caused the long bones of the legs to be shorter than usual, and that the mutation had apparently occurred spontaneously within the feline gene pool. Concerned that these cats would have spinal dysfunction, degenerative disc disease, or hip dysplasia like the short-legged Dachshund, Corgi, and Basset Hound dog breeds, the breeders had the spines of a number of Munchkins examined and X-rayed by David Biller, D.V.M, head of radiology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University. No problems were discovered, but at the time the breed was so new and bloodlines so limited that the studies were not considered definitive. Independently, breeders had their oldest Munchkins X-rayed and examined for signs of joint or bone problems. No problems were found, but opponents pointed out that absence of proof wasn’t proof of absence, since the oldest Munchkin was only about thirteen years old at that time, and the others X-rayed were younger still.<br><br>Hochenedel and LaFrance wrote the first breed standard, and established a breeding program. Other breeders soon joined their cause and established their own Munchkin breeding programs. In 1991, the Munchkin was introduced to the public at the nationally televised INCATS TICA show at Madison Square Garden in New York City, to both acclaim and resistance. They tried to gain recognition for the Munchkin with TICA at that time, but were turned down on the basis that not enough was known about the breed. In 1994, the Munchkin breeders tried again, and this time the breed was accepted into TICA’s New Breed development program in September of that year. TICA’s New Breed development program is overseen by TICA’s genetics committee, which tracks the pedigrees and monitors the breeding statistics as a breed develops, including the outcrosses used to develop the breed. This program confirmed that the gene governing the short legs was dominant; any cat that possesses the gene will have the foreshortened legs, and can pass along the trait to its offspring. As of May 1, 1995, the Munchkin was recognized for New Breed and Color (NBC) status in TICA.<br><br>When the acceptance was announced, one of the long-time TICA members resigned her ten-year judging position, saying the breed was an affront to any breeder with ethics. Others shared her sentiments, feeling that the short legs would cause crippling back, hip, and leg problems in the future, although no evidence existed that the Munchkin is prone to such problems. However, other judges and fanciers were more tolerant or open-minded, and many cat lovers were enthusiastic about the new breed. Negative attitudes toward Munchkins are more frequent within the cat fancy than from the general public, say breeders. Ironically, the controversy surrounding the breed contributed to its growing popularity. Because of articles in The Wall Street Journal, People, and other publications, demand for the sports car of the cat fancy increased until breeders had trouble meeting the demand. Waiting lists were long, and the supply limited. The sports car of the cat fancy commanded sports car prices, too, and breeders were concerned that unscrupulous people would take advantage of the Munchkin’s popularity and use unethical backyard breeding practices.<br><br>After years of development and controversy, the Munchkin achieved TICA championship status in May 2003. Today, the breed is accepted for championship in AACE, TICA, and UFO in both long and short hair, but as of yet have not been able to receive recognition in ACFA, CCA, CFF, and CFA. The Munchkin has been accepted by some associations in other countries as well, such as the Waratah National Cat Alliance in Australia, the United Feline Organization in the United Kingdom, and the Southern Africa Cat Council in South Africa. Other associations have refused to accept the breed; the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) added to their rules they won’t recognize any breed “showing as a breed characteristic a dominant gene resulting in shortened limbs and legs and other physical defects, for example, the Munchkin.” The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) released a statement in 1991 that it “will strongly discourage anyone from importing such a cat [as the Munchkin] and that there was no intention of recognizing this or any other new breed which was based on abnormal structure or development.” To keep the breed healthy and to widen the still relatively small gene pool, outcrossing to long-legged domestic longhairs and shorthairs that are not members of recognized breeds will continue in the future. Because of this, the body and head conformation, as well as color, pattern, hair length, and coat type, may vary as new genes are introduced.<br><br>"

    # Nebelung
    NB: 
      name: "Nebelung"
      short_description: "Nebelung cats look similar to the Russian Blue, but they are two separate breeds. The Nebulung is recognizable by its thick, shimmering blue coat and adored for its sweet, affectionate personality. Make sure you have plenty of time to spend with this loyal cat."
      personality: "The best thing about Nebelungs is their personality. Affectionate, sweet, and loving, Nebelungs form close bonds of love and trust with their human companions and stay extremely devoted and loyal their entire lives.<br><br>Nebelungs are playful, affectionate, and intelligent, and follow their favorite humans from room to room to keep an eye on the action. Sit down, and your lap will quickly be filled by silky soft fur; Nebelungs enjoy sitting beside or in the laps of their chosen humans to receive their due of petting and pampering. They tend to bond with a select few humans and stay loving and dedicated throughout their lives.<br><br>This breed likes a steady routine, will learn yours quickly, and dislike disruptions to their habits; Nebelungs need time to adjust to household changes. They tend to adapt slowly to changes in their routines or the routines of their humans; if you go back to working full time after being at home for many months, Nebelungs may have trouble adjusting. It’s important to make sure that your Nebelung gets plenty of love and attention during times of change. If you must leave a Nebelung alone for long hours, provide a compatible cat companion to keep your Nebelung company while you’re away earning the cat food. Early socializing can help your Nebelung adapt more easily. They are soft-spoken unless something is seriously wrong, such as empty food dishes or cat boxes that are not up to the Nebelung standard of cleanliness. This breed tends to be particular about their environment, and will make their feelings known about litter boxes that offend their sensitive noses or cuisine that doesn’t meet their high standards.<br><br>Nebelungs are generally reserved around strangers, ranging from hiding-under-the-bed timid to warily eyeing intruders from a safe distance. Given the sometimes unpredictable behavior of some humans, this could be interpreted as a sign of this breed’s extreme intelligence. To their chosen family, however, Nebelungs are affectionate and playful."
      history: "The Nebelung (NAY-bel-ung) breed began the way so many of our breeds began—a stray cat wandered out of the mist and developed into a unique new breed. This breed’s saga began in the early 1980s, when a shorthaired black female feline and her black longhaired Angora-type suitor produced a litter of three. One of the shorthaired black females was given to the son of computer programmer Cora Cobb of Denver, Colorado, who named the kitten Elsa.<br><br>In August 1984, Elsa produced a litter of her own, with the help of a shorthaired Russian Blue-type tomcat. Both Elsa and her blue-haired boyfriend must have possessed the recessive gene for long hair, because Elsa’s litter of six included one beautiful longhaired solid blue male. Quite taken with the handsome blue fuzz ball, Cora Cobb adopted the kitten and named him Siegfried after the hero in her favorite Wagner opera, The Ring of the Nibelung. As Siegfried grew, Cobb was taken by Siegfried’s beauty and devoted personality— he was the most loving, devoted cat she’d ever known. When Elsa’s next litter, fathered by the same Russian Blue-type tom, produced a lovely longhaired female kitten that possessed many of Siegfried’s delightful characteristics, Cobb obtained her and named her Brunhilde, after the heroine in Wagner’s opera. The blue female was beautiful and sweet, and her silky hair was longer and lighter than Siegfried’s. Now that Cobb had a matching set of these loving and beautiful blue cats, she decided to see if she could preserve their beauty and loving temperament by breeding brother to sister. If she could produce cats as extraordinary and beautiful as these two, Cobb thought, everyone would want one.<br><br>When Cobb moved to El Paso, Texas, in 1985, she took Siegfried and Brunhilde with her. In 1986, Brunhilde accepted her brother as mate, and about two months later she produced a litter of three blue longhairs. To Cobb’s delight, all three inherited Siegfried’s Russian Blue body type and Brunhilde’s longer, glossy blue fur. Since Cobb was unfamiliar with the genetics of breeding cats, she didn’t know that blue, longhaired kittens were the only possible outcome of Siegfried’s and Brunhilde’s rendezvous. Both long hair and blue coloration are governed by recessive genes; to express those traits in their physical appearance each had to possess two copies of each gene. Since both Siegfried’s and Brunhilde had solid blue coloration and long hair, all offspring would have both traits as well.<br><br>Cobb named the breed the Nebelung, a German word that loosely means “creatures of the mist,” an appropriate name for a feline that magically vanishes into thin air when strangers come to visit. She decided to see what it would take to establish her new breed of cat. On the advice of TICA’s genetics chairperson, Dr. Solveig Pflueger, to whom Cobb turned for guidance in establishing her new breed, Cobb wrote the Nebelung’s standard almost word for word from the Russian Blue’s, except for the coat length and the general opening description. TICA accepted the Nebelung for registration in September 1987.<br><br>The Nebelung has appeared twice on the front cover of a Japanese cat magazine, and Nebelungs were shown at the 1989 TICA cat show in Paris, France. As of May 1, 1997, the Nebelung was granted championship status in TICA, a major step forward that brought the breed national and international attention. Today, Nebelungs are recognized by ACFA, CFF, and TICA, as well as the international associations the World Cat Federation (WCF), and Livre Officiel des Origines Félines (LOOF)."

    # Norwegian Forest Cat
    NF: 
      name: "Norwegian Forest Cat"
      short_description: "The Norwegian Forest Cat is a sturdy cat with a distinguishing double coat and easily recognizable body shape. This is a slow maturing breed, attaining full growth at approximately five years of age."
      personality: "Natural athletes, Norwegian Forest Cats love to investigate counters, bookcases, and the loftiest peaks of their cat trees. Wegies are active and playful and retain their fun-loving spirit well into adulthood, but don’t be fooled by the breed’s impressive muscles and all-weather exterior. They are sweet, friendly, and family-oriented, and they love their human companions.<br><br>Despite the wild years in the forests of Norway—or perhaps because of it—they would much rather cuddle than prowl. Perhaps, because of years spent in Norway’s harsh climate, nothing fazes them much, either. They take new people and new situations in stride; as cats go, Forest Cats are the strong, silent types. They are conversely great purrers, particularly when perched beside their favorite humans. Outgoing and gregarious, they tend not to bond with one person, but rather love everyone unconditionally and enthusiastically."
      history: "The Norwegian Forest Cat, called the skogkatt (forest cat) in Norway, is a natural breed and despite a feral appearance is not a descendant or a hybrid of any wild cat species. Forest Cats probably arrived in Norway from Europe, descendants of domestic cats introduced to northern Europe by the Romans.<br><br>It is supposed that the Norwegian Forest Cat has existed for a long time, since several mentions of large, longhaired cats exist in Norse mythology. Estimates of when these cat tales were written vary greatly. Most Norse myths were passed down by oral tradition and were finally recorded in what was called the Edda poems, written sometime between 800 c.e. and 1200 c.e. These myths suggest that domestic cats have been in Norway for hundreds, possibly thousands, of years. Whether the cats portrayed in the myths are Forest Cats is subject to debate.<br><br>When cats arrived in the northern countries, most likely with human settlers, traders, or crusaders, the breed’s ancestors were probably shorthaired, since the cats transported by the Romans came from Egypt (generally) and were shorthaired varieties. The cats survived and in time adapted to the severe climate. Northern Norway, where the sun never sets from May 12 to August 1, and where the winter nights are correspondingly long and dark, proved a harsh test for these cats. Over the centuries of prowling the Norwegian forests, they developed long, dense, water-resistant coats, hardy constitutions, quick wits, and well-honed survival instincts.<br><br>The first efforts to have the Forest Cat recognized as a distinct breed began in the 1930s. However, after World War II, the breed came close to extinction. It wasn’t until the 1970s that the cat fans in Norway began working to preserve the Norwegian Forest Cat.<br><br>Wegies (as Norwegian Forest Cats are affectionately known) arrived in the United States in 1980. TICA, the first to recognize the breed, accepted the Norwegian Forest Cat for championship competition in 1984. The breed attained CFA championship status in 1993."

    # Persian
    PS: 
      name: "Persian"
      short_description: "The Persian is a heavily boned, well-balanced cat with a sweet expression and soft, round lines. This cat has large round eyes set wide apart in a large round head. The long thick coat softens the lines of the cat and accentuates the roundness in appearance."
      personality: "If you want your cats bouncing around like hyperactive popcorn, don’t adopt a Persian. Persians are perfect companions, if you like placid, sweet-tempered cats. Don’t count on using your Persian pal as a furry doorstop, however. They love to play between periods of regal lounging on your favorite davenport. Proponents say that Persians do not deserve their furniture-with-fur reputation; they are intelligent, just not as inquisitive as some breeds, and not as active.<br><br>Persians are devoted to their humans, but can be selective in conferring that honor. You must earn their trust and love. They crave affection and love to be petted and fussed over, but won’t harass you for attention the way some breeds will. They will, however, let their feelings be known if they are not getting the requisite amount of attention.<br><br>Persians require significant time commitment. That beautiful coat requires daily grooming to keep it in good condition and free of mats. Many Persians require professional grooming."
      history: "Persians have enjoyed a long reign as a favorite breed and have featured prominently since 1871. Persians have been around for much longer than 125 years. Longhaired cats, including the ancestors of the modern Persian and Angora breeds, were first seen in Europe in the mid-to-late 1500s, introduced by Roman and Phoenician caravans from Persia (now Iran) and Turkey, according to documents of the era. Researchers believe the recessive gene for long hair appeared spontaneously via mutation in the cat population in the cold mountainous areas of Persia.<br><br>An Italian traveler by the name of Pietro della Valle (1586–1652) is credited with bringing Persian cats to the European world in the 1600s. Both Angora and Persian cats are mentioned in the manuscript Voyages de Pietro della Valle. He described the Persians as gray with very long, silky, glossy fur. He noted that the cats resided in the province of Khorazan in Persia, and that they came from India with the Portuguese.<br><br>Other travelers brought Persian and Angora cats into France and then into England, causing them to be called “French cats” for a number of years. These cats quickly became popular in Britain. During this time and for centuries after, the Turkish Angora and Persian varieties (among others) were commonly mixed. At first, Angoras were preferred for their silky white coats. Eventually, however, the British came to favor the stockier version. By 1871, distinct differences between the Persian and the Angora could be seen, the former being stockier with small, rounded ears, and the latter being slender and tall eared.<br><br>By the early 1900s, the Persian had become overwhelmingly popular. Blue Persians were particularly prized, probably because Queen Victoria was the proud pet parent of two. In the early 1900s, it was decided that the Persian, as well as the Angora and Russian Longhairs, would be known simply as Longhairs, a policy that continues today. Each color is considered a separate breed in Britain.<br><br>Persians were brought to America in the late 1800s, where they were enthusiastically received. The Persian quickly shoved aside the competition and quickly took the place as the top cat. The American Persian developed a unique style and evolved into the type we see today. They are by far the most popular pedigreed breed in the North America. In North America, the Persian is considered one breed, regardless of color. Colors and patterns are divisions within the breed."

    # Ragamuffin
    RM: 
      name: "Ragamuffin"
      short_description: "The overall impression of the Ragamuffin is one of sweetness and robust health. The large, expressive eyes strongly contribute to the overall sweet look. The only extremes in this cat are large size, large expressive eyes, and docile nature. Ragamuffins attain full maturity at approximately four years of age."
      personality: "Ragdolls and Ragamuffins have temperaments that are very similar. Very lovable and attentive, the Ragamuffin is a people-oriented breed that’s cuddly and affectionate, with a tendency to go limp when held in your arms. While not overly active, they enjoy playing with their preferred people, and some will retrieve tossed toys, before settling down for a cuddle in your lap. They greet family members at the door and follow their favorite humans around the house, just to keep an eye on their activities.<br><br>Although they are not an overly vocal breed, they will speak up if they have something vital to tell you, such as the empty state of their food dishes. These cats adapt easily to a variety of environments and household situations, and are generally very good with other cats, dogs, and well-behaved children."
      history: "The Ragamuffin is not a new breed, but rather is as old as the better-known Ragdoll. The history of the Ragamuffin is intertwined with the history of the Ragdoll breed. The first cat of this breed, Josephine, was a semi-feral solid white Turkish Angora-type cat that resided in Riverside, California. One of her kittens, a mitted seal point longhair with a white blaze and a white tail tip named Daddy Warbucks, went on to become one of the foundation males of the breed. The cats that had the pointed pattern and mitted feet were called Cherubim, but others came in a variety of solid and bi-color patterns. The non-pointed and non-mitted cats were called Miracle Ragdolls. The name Ragdoll was trademarked in 1971 by the breed’s founder, but in 1975, some individuals split from the founder’s Ragdoll association, naming their new breed Ragamuffin instead.The Ragamuffin was represented as a new breed, not as a new Ragdoll color division, and therefore had to go through each phase of acceptance and meet each association’s requirements as a new breed. However, they persisted, and today all associations except CCA recognize the Ragamuffin, although TICA has yet to accept the breed beyond registration status.<br><br>The Ragamuffin has a solid base of fans who believe the breed is the cat’s meow. The Ragamuffin is similar, but not identical, to the Ragdoll because of the many years of separation between the two breeds. The Ragamuffin comes in a wider variety of colors, and the body type is slightly different."

    # Ragdoll
    RD: 
      name: "Ragdoll"
      short_description: "The Ragdoll is a well-balanced cat. They are a medium to large, moderately longhaired, blue-eyed pointed cats. Ragdolls are slow maturing, reaching full coat and color at about three years of age. The Ragdoll is an affectionate and intelligent cat, giving the impression of graceful movement and subdued power, striking in appearance."
      personality: "Docile, mild-mannered, and congenial, Ragdolls make ideal indoor companions. One of the nicest features of these cats is their laid-back, sweet personality. They are devotion wrapped in silky fur, loving loyalty with gentle white paws. Very in tune with their human’s routines and emotions, Ragdolls are there when you come home at night to greet you with a leg rub, a forehead kiss, and a big purr. If you’ve had a bad day, they’ll cuddle into your lap to offer gentle comfort so that soon you’ll be smiling again. A better friend you couldn’t have.<br><br>They are playful but are not overactive. Known to adapt easily to almost any environment, Ragdolls get along well with children and adults, as well as other cats and dogs. They are easily trained to stay off the counter and are affectionate without being overly demanding. They have soft, polite voices, even at dinnertime, even though they are renowned for their enthusiasm for food. One thing Ragdolls are not, however, is impervious to pain. If you accidentally step on their tails, they’ll shriek and eye you reproachfully, just as any other cat will."
      history: "The Ragdoll is a breed whose origins are surrounded by mystery, controversy, and tall tales. Instead of facts, we have colorful stories, speculation, conjecture, and plain old fiction. Telling one from the other is easier said than done. The Ragdoll was developed in the 1960s by the late Ann Baker of Riverside, California. In fact, who, where, and when are just about the only details involving the breed’s origins that are not subject to debate. The foundation cat from which the breed originated, Josephine, was a semi-feral longhaired white female of unknown parentage. Despite Ann Baker’s colorful stories, it’s likely that the foundation cat possessed some exceptional genes, either recessive or masked by her dominant white color, allowing for some striking offspring. These striking offspring, in particular a mitted sealpoint longhaired male with a white blaze and a white tail tip named Daddy Warbucks, became the foundation of the Ragdoll breed.<br><br>In 1971, Ann Baker trademarked the name Ragdoll, and after years of selective breeding, the Ragdoll developed into the breed known today. It took many years of effort to overcome the strange tales and controversies behind the breed, but with the Ragdoll’s hard-won CFA championship status granted in February 2000, the breed was finally recognized for championship by every major North American cat association. The Ragdoll has earned a place in the spotlight, just as this cat has earned a place in the laps and hearts of people everywhere.<br><br>"

    # Russian Blue
    RB: 
      name: "Russian Blue"
      short_description: "The Russian Blue cat is recognizable by his beautiful green eyes and a striking blue coat that has a lustrous sheen."
      personality: "Russian Blues are known to be quiet, gentle, genteel cats, and are usually reserved or absent when strangers come to call. When they’re with their own beloved and trusted humans, however, they are playful and affectionate. Russian Blues are active but not overly so. They like nothing better than to spend time pouncing on a favorite toy or chasing sunbeams. They willingly entertain themselves, but prefer games in which their preferred people take an active role. When you’re home, they follow you around, unobtrusive but ever-present companions.<br><br>The slight upturn to the corners of the mouth make Russian Blues appear to be forever smiling. Members of this breed are generally polite, quiet, and well-behaved, for cats. It’s quite easy to teach them to stay off counters and out of off-limit areas; usually a simple “No” will do. However, Russian Blues seem to think politeness should go both ways and take offense at being made to look silly. A dignified cat, Russian Blues can be trusted to know when you’re making fun of them—and they won’t soon forget this breach in manners, either.<br><br>Russian Blues like their daily routine to be just so, and dislike household changes more than the average cat— and the average cat dislikes household changes a lot. They particularly dislike changes to their dinner schedule, and will make you aware of their displeasure. They are also fastidious about their litter boxes and will complain or may even go elsewhere if they’re not spic and span."
      history: "The most commonly held theory regarding this breed’s origin is that Russian Blues were brought to Great Britain in 1860 by British sailors from the White Sea port town of Archangel (Arkhangelsk) in northern Russia. Whether this story is true—and if true, whether the cats really originated in that area—is anyone’s guess. Their thick coats give credence to the theory that they developed in a cold climate, and, according to accounts, blue shorthairs still exist in Russia.<br><br>The Russian Blue is not believed to be related to the other three shorthaired solid blue breeds: Thailand’s Korat, France’s Chartreux, and Britain’s British Blue (now called the British Shorthair). The four breeds have distinct differences in coat type, conformation, and personality, although the Korat, Chartreux, and Russian Blue share a similar silver-blue sheen. Since all four of these breeds have been around for so long that their ancestries are shrouded in legend and conjecture, a common ancestor is possible.<br><br>In 1871 a Russian Blue was shown at the first cat show at the Crystal Palace in London, under the name Archangel Cat. At this point, Russian Blues were shorthaired, solid blue felines with foreign body types. From photos and published sources of the time, the original coat was thick, dense, glossy, and colored a light silver-blue. Russian Blues competed in the same class with all other shorthaired blues, despite obvious differences in type. Since the round-headed, cobby British Blues were favored in the show halls, the slender Russian Blues rarely won.<br><br>Finally, the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) acknowledged the breed, and in 1912 the Russian Blue was granted a class of its own. The breed then made progress until World War II when it almost became extinct, as did many other breeds.<br><br>The Russian Blue arrived in America in the early 1900s, but it was not until 1947 that serious attempts at breeding and promoting in the United States began. Russian Blues are now accepted for championship in all North American cat associations."

    # Scottish Fold
    SF: 
      name: "Scottish Fold"
      short_description: "The Scottish Fold cat occurred as a spontaneous mutation in farm cats in Scotland. The breed has been established by crosses to British Shorthair and domestic cats in Scotland and England. In America, the outcross is the American and British Shorthair. All bona fide Scottish Fold cats trace their pedigree to Susie."
      personality: "Scottish Folds are typically intelligent, sweet-tempered, soft-spoken, and easily adaptable to new people and situations. They are loyal and tend to bond with one person in the household. While they will usually allow others to cuddle and pet them, their primary attachment becomes quickly clear as they single out their chosen human. They thrive on attention, but it must be on their own terms. Despite their devotion, they are not clingy, demanding cats and usually prefer to be near you rather than on your lap. They enjoy a good game of catch the catnip mouse now and then as well, and keep their playful side well into adulthood.<br><br>Despite being folded, the Fold’s ears are still expressive and swivel to listen, lay back in anger, and prick up when a can of food is opened. The fold in the ear can become less pronounced when the cat is upset or ill. Although some Fold family members report an increased production of wax buildup in their cats’ ears, the folded ears typically do not make the cat more susceptible to mites or ear infections. The previously reported susceptibility to deafness may be related to the fact that some early Scottish Folds were white, and white cats can be prone to a type of deafness that’s unrelated to the Fold gene."
      history: "All Scottish Folds can trace their pedigrees back to a cat named Susie found in 1961 on the McRae farm near Coupar Angus, a town in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. This white female farm feline had unique, folded down ears, and British Shorthair breeders William and Mary Ross, upon seeing this unusual cat, recognized her potential as a new breed.<br><br>William Ross asked the McRaes if he could purchase the cat, and was promised a kitten from Susie’s first litter. Susie’s mother was a straight-eared white cat, and her father was unknown, so it’s unclear whether Susie was one of the first of her kind or whether the folded ears had never been noticed before. In 1963, Susie produced two folded-ear kittens, and as promised William and Mary Ross were given one—a folded-ear white beauty like her mother that they named Snooks.<br><br>On the advice of British geneticist Peter Dyte, the Rosses started a breeding program using as outcrosses the British Shorthairs that were close on hand in their cattery, and random-bred domestics. They took the name Denisla as their Fold cattery named after the two rivers, the Den and the Isla, which flowed past their cottage.<br><br>William and Mary Ross quickly realized that the gene governing the folded ears was dominant; only one parent needed the gene in order to pass along the unique trait. Any cat possessing one copy of the fold gene produced about fifty percent of Fold kittens.<br><br>Originally, the Rosses called their new breed Lops after the lop-ear type of rabbit. In 1966, however, they changed the name to Scottish Fold, in honor of this most extraordinary trait and the country in which the breed was found. The same year, the Rosses registered their Scottish Fold cats with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). Along with other enthusiasts they gathered along the way, the Rosses began the process of achieving acceptance for their folded friends.<br><br>At first, a number of breeders and fanciers were enthusiastic about this new and different breed, but soon GCCF became concerned about potential health problems. At first, they were worried about ear infections, ear mite infestations, and deafness, but these concerns were proven unfounded. However, GCCF soon became concerned about genetic problems, which were, unfortunately, very real difficulties. By 1971, GCCF closed registration to Scottish Folds and banned further registration in their registry. To continue toward the show ring, the Scottish Fold had to pack up its kilts and move to North America.<br><br>All genuine Scottish Folds can be traced back to Susie. The Scottish Fold was accepted for CFA registration in 1973; in May 1977 Scottish Folds were given CFA provisional status. In 1978, the Fold became a CFA champion breed. In an amazingly short period, the Fold earned acceptance in all the North American cat associations and a place among North America’s most popular breeds. The longhaired version of the breed was not officially recognized until the mid-1980s, although longhair kittens had been cropping up in Scottish Fold litters since the genesis of the breed. Suzie may have carried the recessive gene for long hair, being a cat of uncertain origin.<br><br>The use of a number of Persians in early outcrosses also helped establish the longhair gene. Today, all associations have accepted the Scottish Fold Longhair for championship, although many associations have a separate standard for the longhair and call it the Highland Fold or the Longhair Fold. The Scottish Fold Longhair is known by three different monikers, depending on the association. AACE, ACFA, and UFO call the breed the Highland Fold; CFF refers to the breed as the Longhair Fold. In CFA and TICA, the longhaired Scottish Fold is a division of the Scottish Fold breed and shares one standard in each association. In CCA, the breed is called Scottish, and both hair lengths share one standard, although the two hair lengths are judged as separate breeds. In addition, CCA accepts the Scottish Straight Shorthair and the Scottish Straight Longhair under the name Scottish; these are Scottish Folds that don’t possess folded ears. The Scottish Shorthair, also called the pert-ear, has the same personality and body type as the Scottish Fold; they just don’t have folded ears. Since the Fold doesn’t breed true, the pet-quality pert-ear can be bought relatively inexpensively. In the Australian Cat Federation (ACF), the Scottish Shorthair is accepted as a breed in its own right."

    # Siamese
    SI: 
      name: "Siamese"
      short_description: "The ideal Siamese is a medium-sized, svelte, refined cat with long tapering lines, very lithe but muscular. Males may be proportionately larger. Balance and refinement are the essence of the breed, where all parts come together in a harmonious whole, with neither too much nor too little consideration given to any one feature."
      personality: "Some cats seem to think that a purr or a friendly rub speaks louder than words. Meezers (as Siamese are affectionately called) are not of this school of thought and are known for their talent for clearly communicating their ideas and desires to their human servants. If you can’t be drawn into dialogue, they’re happy to keep up a running monologue for your enlightenment. No meaningless meows, these, but real attempts at communication, according to Siamese fans.<br><br>To some cat lovers, the Siamese rasp (some would say yowl) can be a bit annoying. However, Meezer worshippers wouldn’t have it any other way. According to fans, Meezers are the most wonderful, loving, entertaining cats in the known universe. Siamese are very intelligent, self-assured, playful, determined, curious, and highly active. They love their human companions with a passion; living with the Siamese is a bit like living with exceedingly active children. Except these “children” follow you everywhere, demanding to be involved in whatever you’re doing.<br><br>Determinedly social and very dependent upon their humans, Meezers crave active involvement in your life. They are super-intelligent and if you don’t give them something to do, they will find something to do that you may not approve of quite as much. This breed needs daily periods of play and interaction; it’s critical to the Siamese’s emotional and mental health and well-being. They should not be left alone for long periods; this is not a breed you can pat on the head and leave for twelve hours. Siamese will pine and become depressed if left too often alone, and may become destructive out of the frustrated craving for social interaction. The feline companionship of another Siamese or a comparatively active breed will help keep a lonely Siamese happy while you’re away, but there is no substitute for human interaction. Moreover, remember two Siamese can think up twice as much mischief to get into while you’re out earning the cat food.<br><br>This breed is not for those looking for a quiet companion—Siamese need to be treated with patience and require lots of attention and affection if they are to have the close, caring relationship they require with their human companions. For those who want a soul mate cat companion, however, this is your breed. Siamese are usually good family pets and are tolerant of children at least eight and older, as long as the children are taught how to properly handle cats and don’t play too rough."
      history: "The Siamese is one of the oldest breeds of domestic cat and has a history as long and colorful as the cat itself. The Siamese is also (arguably) the most recognizable breed on the planet. According to accounts, these sleek cats with the brilliant blue eyes and outspoken personality originated in Siam (now Thailand), where they lived in palaces and temples. They were treasured as companions of royalty and religious leaders for generations, and served as guardians of precious documents and valuables in the Buddhist temples.<br><br>These sacred cats were thought to inherit transmigrated souls en route to the hereafter. Early legends involving the Siamese are plentiful, including fanciful tales accounting for the cat’s traits. One such story tells how a Siamese temple cat, charged with guarding a valuable vase, curled its tail around the vase and stared at it with such intensity that its eyes became permanently crossed. Another tale tells of Siamese cats appointed to guard precious rings; the cats kept the rings on their tails and kinks developed to keep the rings from sliding off.<br><br>The Cat-Book Poems, a manuscript of verses and paintings written in the city of Ayutthaya, Siam, some time between 1350 c.e. when the kingdom was founded, and 1767 c.e. when the city was destroyed by invaders, clearly show cats with slim bodies and legs, and pale-colored coats with dark coloring on the ears, faces, tails, and feet. When the book was written can’t be more accurately determined since these manuscripts were handwritten on palm-leaf or bark parchment. When a manuscript became too old, it was painstakingly copied by hand when the original and subsequent copies became too old and fragile to be usable. This makes it difficult to date. Still, it’s likely the oldest document about cats in existence.<br><br>Because the Siamese was so valued in its native land the cats were rarely given to outsiders. However, it’s clear that by the 1800s the Siamese had been exported to Britain. Siamese cats were exhibited in 1871 in the first modern-style cat show at The Crystal Palace in Sydenham, London. At the event, one journalist of the time disparagingly described the breed as “an unnatural, nightmare kind of cat.” Despite this bad press, the Siamese rapidly became popular among British fanciers. At that time, the Siamese were noted for their crossed eyes and kinked tails; these didn’t become conformation faults until later. The first British standard, written in 1892 and rewritten in 1902, described the Siamese as a “striking-looking cat of medium size, if weighty, not showing bulk, as this would detract from the admired svelte appearance… also distinguished by a kink in the tail.”<br><br>Siamese must have become used to posh dwellings from its years with royalty; the first Siamese imported to North America lived in the White House. This well-documented account occurred in November of 1878, when David B. Sickels, a U.S. diplomat stationed at the consulate in Bangkok, sent a Siamese cat to first lady Lucy Hayes. In a letter that can be viewed in the Paper Trail archives of the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center, Sickels wrote, “I have taken the liberty of forwarding you one of the finest specimens of Siamese cats that I have been able to procure in this country . . . I am informed that this is the first attempt ever made to send a Siamese cat to America.”<br><br>By the early 1900s, Siamese cats began appearing in North American cat shows. The breed rapidly clawed its way to the top of the cat fancy’s scratching post, and today is one of most popular shorthaired breed in North America. Due to its popularity, the breed has been used in the matrix of many modern cat breeds, including the Ocicat, Himalayan, Burmese, Tonkinese, and Oriental breeds, such as the Oriental Shorthair, Oriental Longhair, and the Balinese.<br><br>Although the Extreme Siamese is favored in the show ring, the Old-Style Siamese (known as the Thai in TICA and some of the European associations; see profile on page 270) has an enthusiastic following of breeders and fanciers who prefer this moderate type of Siamese. In some associations, the Thai is synonymous with “Old-Style Siamese”; CFF accepts the Old-Style Siamese for championship, and UFO accepts the Old-Style Siamese, the Old-Style Balinese, and the Old-Style Colorpoint for championship. Other fanciers refer to this type by the term “Applehead,” which is more colloquial and informal. These fanciers believe the Old-Style’s rounder, heavier body style is closer to the original type that existed before humans began selectively breeding for a svelte body style and elongated head type. Extreme breeders, on the other hand, believe that the Extreme body style is the original look, which became adulterated through dubious crosses in the early years. They are dedicated to preserving the natural, sleek elegance of the Extreme Siamese.<br><br>Extreme and Old-Style Siamese fanciers continue to hiss at each other over the difference in style, and it’s difficult to say who is correct. The illustrations of the Siamese in the Cat-Book Poems show cats with long, slender legs and tails; however, the body type could be interpreted as either Extreme or Old-Style, depending upon one’s point of view. Both sides agree on one thing, though: Siamese make wonderful companions.<br><br>If you’re looking for a cat with personality, an impish nature, and a talent for conversation, both the Extreme and the Old-Style will fit the bill. If you’re looking for success in the show ring, the Extreme is favored in many associations."

    # Siberian
    SB: 
      name: "Siberian"
      short_description: "The Siberian, Russia’s native forest cat, hails from the unforgiving climate of Siberia. This is a cat that nature designed to survive. The Siberian is a medium to medium large, strong triple-coated cat with surprising heft for its size. The breed is extremely slow to mature taking as long as 5 years."
      personality: "Siberians are affectionate cats with a good dose of personality and playfulness. They are amenable to handling, and it is noted that Siberians have a fascination with water, often dropping toys into their water dishes or investigating bathtubs before they’re dry. Siberians seem very intelligent, with the ability to problem-solve to get what they want.<br><br>Despite their size, they are very agile and are great jumpers, able to leap tall bookcases in a single bound. Siberians are very people-oriented, and need to be near their owners. They’ll meet you at the door when you come home and tell you about their day, and want to hear about yours.<br><br>Siberians are talkative but not nearly as chatty as Oriental breeds; they express themselves using quiet meows, trills, chirps, and lots of motorboat-type purring. They like sitting on your lap while they’re being groomed, an activity they particularly enjoy. Another favorite game is bringing a toy for you to throw again and again— and again. They love all types of toys— and will make a toy out of just about anything. Nature shows on TV with chirping birds or squeaking mice will bring your Siberians running; they’ll put gentle feet on the screen and try to catch the fluttering images."
      history: "This breed may be new to North America, but it’s far from new to the world. Longhaired Russian cats have been around for many hundreds of years. Exactly when and how longhaired cats made their way to Siberia is not known, but it is speculated that the breed arrived with Russian emigrants. According to some Siberian fanciers, Russians immigrating (or being exiled) to Siberia brought their cats with them. The mutation for long hair seems to have occurred in three separate areas—Russia, Persia (Iran), and Asia Minor (Turkey). However, it’s possible that the longhair mutation originally occurred in Russia and that Russian Longhairs spread from Russia into Turkey, crossbreeding with local cats to become the Angora, and into Persia, crossbreeding with local cats to become the Persian. If so, all longhairs are derived from the Russian Longhair.<br><br>Long fur in domestic cats appears to be an adaptation to cold, and it’s certainly cold in Siberia. Due to the merciless climate, these cats developed, or acquired through mating with the local cats, longer hair, all-weather coats, and larger, stockier bodies. The cats survived and developed into a hardy, longhaired breed able to withstand the unforgiving conditions of the region.<br><br>According to Russian stories, Siberian cats once weighed up to 45 pounds and protected their human companions and households. In Harrison Weir’s 1889 book, Our Cats and All About Them, he noted in the chapter on longhaired cats the varieties of longhaired cats that existed in his time, and were shown in his famous modern cat show in July 1871 at the Crystal Palace in London, were the Russian, Angora, Persian, and Indian. Weir, known as “the Father of the Cat Fancy,” wrote that the Russian Longhair differs from Angoras and Persians in a number of ways, including its larger size, longer mane, large prominent bright orange eyes, and its long, dense, woolly textured coat including the tail that’s thickly covered with very woolly hair. However, the Russian longhairs who shared the limelight at the show may or may not have been Siberians, since apparently no records of these cats were kept in Russia at that time.<br><br>Until the 1980s, the government of the former Soviet Union discouraged its citizens from owning household pets because of housing and food shortages. In 1987, the government lifted restrictions on house pets, and breeders and fanciers formed cat clubs and began keeping breeding records. In 1988, the first Russian cat show was held in Moscow. Terrell sent four Himalayans to Nelli Sachuk and in exchange received three Siberians on June 28, 1990—one male (Kaliostro Vasenjkovich) and two females (Ofelia Romanova and Naina Romanova). Soon after, she received the kittens’ metrukas (certificates of birth), which detailed their names, dates of birth, and colors and patterns. Before long, the Siberian had captivated Terrell’s heartstrings and purse strings. She invested thousands of dollars and expended many hours obtaining more cats and establishing the Siberian as a recognized breed in America. Just a month after Elizabeth Terrell received her Siberians, breeder David Boehm imported a number of Siberians of his own. Instead of waiting for cats to be sent, he booked a flight to Russia and bought every Siberian he could find. On July 4 he returned with a collection of fifteen cats. His Siberians produced the first litter in North America, and were invaluable in enlarging the Siberian gene pool."

    # Sphynx
    SX: 
      name: "Sphynx"
      short_description: "The most distinctive feature of this cat is its appearance of hairlessness. The Sphynx is of medium size and body conformation with surprising weight for its size. The body feels warm and soft to the touch, with a skin texture akin to either a soft peach or a smooth nectarine. The Sphynx is sweet-tempered, lively, and amenable to handling."
      personality: "To say Sphynxes are lively is an understatement; they perform monkey-like aerialist feats from the top of doorways and bookshelves. Very devoted and loyal, they follow their humans around, wagging their tails doggy fashion, kneading with their padded toes, and purring with delight at the joy of being near their beloved humans. They demand your unconditional attention and are as mischievous (and lovable) as children. And despite all that and their alien appearance, they are still entirely cats, with all the mystery and charm that has fascinated humankind for thousands of years. While the Sphynx may not be for everyone, its unique appearance and charming temperament has won it an active, enthusiastic following."
      history: "The Sphynx is not the first instance of hairlessness in domestic cats. This natural, spontaneous mutation has been seen in various locations around the world for more than a century, and probably much longer.<br><br>The Book of the Cat by Frances Simpson, published in 1903, mentioned a pair of gray and white hairless cats, Dick and Nellie, belonging to an Albuquerque, New Mexico cat lover named F. J. Shinick. Called the “Mexican Hairless,” these cats looked similar to today’s Sphynx, and supposedly were obtained from Indians around Albuquerque. According to Mr. Shinick’s letter, “The old Jesuit Fathers tell me they are the last of the Aztec breed known only in New Mexico.” It’s unknown if that was true, but Dick and Nellie died without producing offspring.<br><br>In 1950, a pair of Siamese cats in Paris, France, produced a litter that included three hairless kittens. The results were repeated in subsequent matings of the same pair, but breeding the parents to other Siamese cats produced no new hairless kittens. Other hairless felines turned up in Morocco, Australia, North Carolina, and, in 1966, in Roncesvalles, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where a pair of domestic shorthairs produced a litter that included a hairless kitten named Prune. A breeder obtained the parents and began a breeding program; the breed was named the Canadian Hairless. Prune was mated with his mother, which produced one hairless kitten.<br><br>In 1970, CFA granted provisional status to the breed. This line had a number of difficulties; the gene pool was limited, and some kittens died from undiagnosed health problems. In 1971, CFA withdrew the recognition due to the breed’s health problems. The last of Prune’s line was sent to Holland to Dr. Hugo Hernandez in the 1970s. In 1978 and 1980, two hairless female kittens believed to be related to Prune were found in Toronto. They were sent to Holland to be bred with Prune’s last surviving male descendant. One female conceived, but she lost the litter. None of Prune’s descendants went on to become the Sphynx breed we know today.<br><br>In 1975, Minnesota farm owners Milt and Ethelyn Pearson discovered a hairless kitten had been born to their normal-coated farm cat, Jezabelle. This kitten, named Epidermis, was joined the next year by another hairless kitten named Dermis. Both were sold to Oregon breeder Kim Mueske, who used the kittens to develop the Sphynx breed. Georgiana Gattenby of Brainerd, Minnesota, also worked with kittens from the Pearson line, using Cornish Rex as an outcross.<br><br>At almost the same time (1978), Siamese breeder Shirley Smith of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, found three hairless kittens on the streets of her neighborhood, which she named Bambi, Punkie, and Paloma. The descendants of Bambi, Punkie, and Paloma in Canada, along with the descendants of Epidermis and Dermis in Oregon, became the foundation of today’s Sphynx. The breed has made considerable strides since its inception.<br><br>While most fanciers have welcomed the Sphynx as unique and exotic, some members of the cat fancy wish that the Sphynx would put on some clothes. Like other breeds that have diverged from the basic design, the Sphynx has drawn some negative attention. In addition, the gene that governs hairlessness can be considered a genetic disorder, since the cat is more susceptible to both heat and cold. On the other hand, fanciers argue that we humans are more or less hairless compared with our closest relatives, and with a dap of sunscreen we manage to get by just fine.<br><br>Association acceptance followed the breed’s creation quite rapidly for such an unusual breed. TICA accepted the breed for championship in 1986. In 1992, CCA recognized the Sphynx for championship. In 1994, ACFA followed suit. In 1998, CFA recognized the new and improved Sphynx lines for registration and in 2002 accepted the breed for championship. The breed is now recognized by all North American cat associations, as well as Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) and the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in Europe."
