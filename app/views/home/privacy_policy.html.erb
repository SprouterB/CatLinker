      <h4>Information that we collect</h4>
      <p>
        We collect information to provide better services to all our users.
        The information Cat Linker collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you’re not signed in to a Cat Linker Account, we store the information that we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application or device that you’re using.
        This helps us do things such as store your cookie consent as well as providing security measures during your visits.
      </p>
      <p> 
        When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Cat Linker Account, which we treat as personal information.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you create a Cat Linker Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your email address and a password.
        Optionally, you can also add the address of your cattery, phone number and other information related to your cattery.
        We also collect the content that you upload when using our services.

      <p>
        We use your information to deliver our services, such as processing the terms you search for in order to return results and we use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Cat Linker Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also use your information to ensure that our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services such as using community feedback to improve a feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use information that we collect, such as your email address, to interact with you directly.
        For example, we may send you a verification email to confirm your email address or reset your password.
        Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services.
        And if you contact Cat Linker, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.

        We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services.
        This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks and technical issues that could harm Cat Linker, our users or the public.
        We use Google reCAPTCHA to analyse your activity to help us detect abuse such as spam and bots.

        We provide an option to login with your Facebook or Google account ("External Login"). You can use this functionality by clicking the 'Facebook login' or 'Google login' buttons on the login page.
        After your consent, we only use the email address linked to your External Login account to create a new account for you in case an account does not yet exist.
        By using one of the External Logins, we also have access to the full name, username and profile picture that is linked to your External Login account, but we do not use this in the application.
